title: "The Rule of 70"

<p>
The rule of 70 is a quick way to approximate doubling time for an exponentially growing quantity. It says:
	
  <div class="media">A quantity with x percent annual growth will take 70/x years to double.</div>
 
On first glance, this should only be accurate for a particular range of x. Below is a simple interactive diagram demonstrating the accuracy of this approximation.
</p>

 <div class="media">
<div class="slidercontainer">
  <input type="range" min="10" max="3000" value="200" class="slider" id="mySlider" oninput="sliderUpdate()">
  <p align="center">Annual percentage growth: <input value="2" size="4" id="numericalValue" type="text" onchange="boxUpdate()"> %</p>
</div>

<div class="chart">
	Exact doubling time:
	<div></div>
	Rule of 70 approximation:
	<div></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>
We see that the approximation is surprisingly good, especially for financial applications. (I was expecting something worse, which is why I began this post to begin with!) For annual growth rates greater than 30%, doubling time is not a very interesting quantity, so it turns out that the rule of 70 is reasonably useful for all nontrivial situations.

<p>
Let's check this outcome mathematically. The exact formula for doubling time given x% annual growth is given by
$$\frac{\log 2}{\log(1 + x/100)}.$$
Approximating log 2 by 0.7 and using the linear approximation
$$\log(1 + y) \approx y,$$
we obtain precisely the rule of 70. The approximation is valid for as long as this linear approximation is valid. This is essentially the case when 1 + y is near 1, so
$$y = x/100 \ll 1$$
suffices.

<script>
var slider = document.getElementById("mySlider");
var output = document.getElementById("numericalValue");
updateValues();
	
function sliderUpdate() {
	output.value = slider.value/100;
	updateValues();	
}

function boxUpdate() {
	slider.value = output.value*100;
	updateValues();	
}
	
function updateValues() {
var exact = Math.log(2)/Math.log(1 + Number(slider.value)/10000);
var approx = 100*70/Number(slider.value)
var data = [exact, approx];
	
  
d3.select(".chart")
  .selectAll("div")
  .data(data)
    .style("width", function(d) { return Number(d)/8 + "%"; })
    .text(function(d) { return Math.round(Number(d)*100)/100 + String.fromCharCode(160) + 'Years'; });
}
</script>
