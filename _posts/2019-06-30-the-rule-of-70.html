<p>
The rule of 70 is a rule of thumb stipulating that a quantity with x percent annual growth will take 70/x years to double. Evidently, this is only accurate for a limited range of x. Below is a simple interactive diagram which shows the accuracy of the rule of 70.

<div class="slidecontainer">
  <input type="range" min="1" max="100" value="50" class="slider" id="myRange">
</div>


<script>
var slider = document.getElementById("myRange");
var output = document.getElementById("demo");
output.innerHTML = slider.value;

slider.oninput = function() {
  output.innerHTML = this.value;
}
</script>
