Welcome!
</p>

<p>
I am a recent PhD in a pure mathematics. However, I am also interested in impure mathematics.
</p>

<p>
I plan for this website to be an educational experience for me (and hopefully you) in web programming, web design, data visualization, data analysis, and mathematics education. I hope to be true to the title of this website, and include interactive diagrams at every opportunity.
</p>

<p>
Topics I hope to eventually discuss include finance, science, and music.
