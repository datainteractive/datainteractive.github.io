Welcome!

I am a recent PhD in a pure mathematics. Sometimes impure mathematics is enticing. This is my outlet.

I plan for this website to be an educational experience for me (and hopefully you) in web programming, web design, data visualization, data analysis, and mathematics education. Topics I hope to come to eventually discuss include finance, science, and music.
